**Project Title:** Bank Loan Data Analysis

Tools Used: Excel, PowerBI (PowerQuery fro Data cleaning), Tableau, MySQL, Python (pandas)

**Project Description:**
This project focuses on analyzing the bank's loan data to provide insights into loan distribution, customer behavior, and performance trends. Using raw loan data provided by the bank, an interactive dashboard was developed to monitor and evaluate key metrics related to loan approvals, disbursements, repayments, and defaults.

The dashboard features key performance indicators (KPIs), charts, and filters to allow for detailed analysis of different loan types, customer segments, and time periods. Tools such as Excel, Power BI, and Tableau were used for data visualization, while MySQL was employed for data processing and cleansing. The analysis helps the bank make data-driven decisions on loan distribution, assess the risk of defaults, and identify areas for improvement to optimize loan management and drive business growth.
